; persist-multi.scm -- Moving Atoms between multiple databases.
;
; The `persistance.scm` demo shows how to save and restore atoms to
; one database (or remote server). This demo shows how to work with
; multiple databases/servers at the same time.
;
; This demo will copy atoms between the Postgres backend and the
; RocksDB backend, although any set of backends can be used. This
; demo requires Postgres to be configured, and the RocksDB backend
; to be installed. If you want to skip Postgres, then just try the
; demo wth two different RocksDB stores.

; For postgres, load the postgres module:
(use-modules (opencog persist-sql))

; For RocksDB, the rocks module. (Won't work, if not installed!)
(use-modules (opencog persist-rocks))

; For the cogserver... (this is also an external component)
(use-modules (opencog persist-cog))

; For postgres, use the test database credentials. These are the
; credentials thatthe unit tests use. Next time the unit tests run,
; they will wipe out this data, and so you should probably create
; and use your own private login.

; Open all of them.

; demo.)
(load-atomspace psn)

; Store everything to Rocks
(store-atomspace rsn)

; Close all of them.
(cog-close psn)
(cog-close rsn)

(cog-open psn)
(cog-open rsn)

; Fetch the same atom from each backend. Note how the TV toggles
; between what has bee stored in each.
(fetch-atom (Concept "asdf") psn)

(fetch-atom (Concept "asdf") psn)
(fetch-atom (Concept "asdf") rsn)

; Just like the above, all fetch/store directives can take an optional
; StorageNode argument, to indicate where they should be applied.

; We're done.
(cog-close psn)
(cog-close rsn)

; That's all for now.
