; copy-on-write.scm -- Copy-on-write into overlay AtomSpaces.
;
; This demonstrates how to create a pair of AtomSpaces, one layered
; on the other, so that changes are limited to the upper layer, leaving
; the base layer undisturbed.  There are two distinct ways of doing
; this. One is to explicitly mark the base layer as read-only. The
; other is to mark the overlay copy-on-write (while leaving the base
; writable.)
;
; There are several expected use cases. The copy-on-write mechanism
; provides a very simple way to create "scratch" or temporary spaces,
; where calculations can be performed, without altering the base space.
;
; The read-only mechanism is a primitive permission system, and can be
; used to implement shared use. One example would be a large read-only
; database holding data that is shared by many people. Individual users
; can then "mount" this database, and make local changes to it (i.e.
; perform read-write operations) without corrupting the underlying
; shared read-only database.

(cog-prt-atomspace)

; The overlay contains only the modified atom.

; Create a Link, and verify that it sits in the overlay.
; Pay attention to where the atoms in the Link sit: some will be
; in the base space, and some will be in the overlay. Which is where
; depends on how each scheme symbol got bound to an atom. This can
; be a source of confusion.

; --- Next, the copy-on-write part of the demo.
; Let's restore the base to being read-write (thus unprotected)
; but mark the overlay as explicitly copy-on-write.

; Go back to the overlay, and verify that it has not been affected.

; Change the TV of `a` in the overlay.
(cog-set-tv! a (cog-new-stv 0.5 0.5))
(cog-prt-atomspace)

; And a grand finale: change the TV of `b`. This will result in a
; new `b` being created in the overlay, with the new TV, while the
; original `b` remains in the base, as it was, unchanged.

; Create a ListLink in the base, with a non-default TV.
; While we're at it, change the TV on `b` as well.
(ListLink a b (stv 0.7 0.7))
(cog-set-tv! b (cog-new-stv 0.8 0.8))
(cog-prt-atomspace)

; Verify that the ListLink in the overlay has the default TV.
; Notice that the ListLink in the overlay was composed with the
; version of `b` that was in the base, and so the TV on that has
; changed.
