; query.scm -- Parallel queries (parallel pattern matching)
;
; QueryLink usage example.
;
; The QueryLink and the BindLink are both very similar; both search
; the AtomSpace for groundings of the query pattern, and then perform
; a re-write, based on the results. The only difference between the two
; is that the BindLink returns a SetLink containing the results, whereas
; the QueryLink returns a LinkValue containing the results. This makes
; the QueryLink a bit nicer, because it does not pollute the AtomSpace
; with nearly-useless SetLinks.
;
; Although both can be run in parallel (i.e. run in different threads),
; there's almost no point to doing so for the BindLink, since you have
; to wait for it to complete, and provide you with the resulting
; SetLink. By contrast, the QueryLink can drop off results at a
; "well-known location" in the AtomSpace, as they appear, so that
; processing can happen in parallel: processing can start on some
; results, even while others are still being found.
;
; This example uses an AnchorNode to establish a "well-known location",
; a QueryLink to attache them there, and a DeleteLink to detach results
; from the AnchorNode. The  ParallelLink is used to run multiple threads,
; and SleepLink to slow it down enough to see what is happening.
;
; Taken as a whole, it demos a toy parallel processing pipeline.
