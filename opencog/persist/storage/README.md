Storage Atom Types
------------------
This defines some atom types, currently, just nodes, that indicate
how to connect up to storage. There are currently three types:

* `PostgresStorageNode` -- connect to a Postgres backend
* `RocksDBStorageNode` -- connect to a RocksDB backend
* `CogserverStorageNode` -- connect to a Cosgserver backend

General information about the `storage_types.script` file can be found
in the `opencog/atoms/atom_types` directory.
