; OVERVIEW
; --------
; The functions below provide convenient access to a "weighted
; vertex-ordered graph". A "vertex-ordered graph" is a graph where
; each vertex in the graph is labelled with an ordinal. This ordering
; can be imagined to give the vertexes a left-to-right ordering.
; The graph is weighted because each of the edges is assigned a weight.
;
; The functions below simply provide an API to access the ordering and
; the weights.
;
; Terminology:
; A "numa" is a NUMbered Atom; it is an ordered vertex. Its an atom,
;    and an integer number indicating it's ordering.
;
; An "overt" is the same thing as a numa, short for Ordered VERTex.
;
; A "wedge" is an edge, consisting of an ordered pair of numa's.
;     Note that ordering of the vertexes in the edge give that
;     edge an implicit directionality. This need NOT correspond
;     to the ordinal numbering of the vertexes. That is, an edge
;     can point from right to left or from left to right!

; of a pair of ordered atoms.
