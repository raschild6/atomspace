 * class Instantiator -- create grounded expressions from ungrounded ones.
 * Given an ungrounded expression (i.e. an expression containing variables)
 * and a map between variables and ground terms, it will create a new
 * expression, with the ground terms substituted for the variables.
 * The final result will be placed in the provided AtomSpace.
 *
 * This also implements generic execution: any executable links are
 * executed as the variable substitution is performed.  In particular,
 * execution is implemented as instantiation, with an empty variable
 * map.
 *
 * See also: `Replacement::replace_nocheck()`, which is similar, except
 * except that no execution is performed, and the result is not placed
 * into any AtomSpace.
