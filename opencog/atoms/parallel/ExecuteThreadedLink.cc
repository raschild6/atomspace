/// When this link is executed, the `ExecutableAtoms...` are executed

/// atoms have been executed, the QueueValue holding the results is
/// returned. Execution blocks until all of the threads have finished.

/// By default, the number of threads launched equals the number of
/// Atoms in the set. If the NumberNode is present, then the number of
/// threads is the smaller of the NumberNode and the seize of the Set.
///
/// XXX TODO: We could have a non-blocking version of this atom. We
/// could just return the QueueValue immediately; the user could check
/// to see if the queue is closed, to find out if the threads have
/// finished.
