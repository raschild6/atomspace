"
 sql-clear-cache - clear the TLB of cached data
    This will free up RAM, maybe a lot, dependeing on how many atoms
    are in the cache. The cost of doing this is that some operations
    on atoms will no longer be cached, and will need to go to the
    database to fetch contents, potentially impacting performance.
")

(set-procedure-property! sql-clear-stats 'documentation
"
 sql-clear-stats - reset the performance statistics counters.
    This will zero out the various counters used to track the
    performance of the SQL backend.  Statistics will continue to
    be accumulated.
")

(set-procedure-property! sql-close 'documentation
"
 sql-close - close the currently open SQL backend.
    Close open connections to the currently-open backend, afterflushing
    any pending writes in the write queues. After the close, atoms can
    no longer be stored to or fetched from the database.

(set-procedure-property! sql-create 'documentation
"
 sql-create URL - Create and initialize a new database,
    Create the database encoded in the URL, and initialize it for
    holding AtomSpace data. This assumes that the user has database
    creation priviledges; otherwise an error will be thrown.

    Currently, the ONLY supported URL formats are:
       postgres:///DBNAME
       postgres://USER@HOST/DBNAME
       postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/DBNAME

  For example, to create the database \"foo\", just say:
     (sql-create \"postgres:///foo\")
  To then use it, you have to open it:
     (sql-open \"postgres:///foo\")
  To delete it, you must say \"dropdb foo\" at the shell (bash) prompt.
")

(set-procedure-property! sql-open 'documentation
"
 sql-open URL - Open a connection to a database.
    Open a connection to the database encoded in the URL. All
    appropriate database credentials must be supplied in the URL,
    including the username and password, if required.

    The URL must be on one of these formats:
       odbc://USER:PASSWORD/DBNAME
       postgres:///DBNAME
       postgres://USER@HOST/DBNAME
       postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/DBNAME
       postgres:///DBNAME?user=USER
       postgres:///DBNAME?user=USER&host=HOST
       postgres:///DBNAME?user=USER&password=PASS

    Other key-value pairs following the question-mark are interpreted
    by the postgres driver, according to postgres documentation.

  Examples of use with valid URL's:
     (sql-open \"odbc://opencog_tester:cheese/opencog_test\")
     (sql-open \"postgres://opencog_tester@localhost/opencog_test\")
     (sql-open \"postgres://opencog_tester:cheese@localhost/opencog_test\")
     (sql-open \"postgres:///opencog_test?user=opencog_tester\")
     (sql-open \"postgres:///opencog_test?user=opencog_tester&host=localhost\")
     (sql-open \"postgres:///opencog_test?user=opencog_tester&password=cheese\")
")

(set-procedure-property! sql-set-hilo-watermarks! 'documentation
"
 sql-set-hilo-watermarks! HI LO - Set the high and low watermarks on the
    writeback queues.  Any threads that are storing atoms will block
    if the backlog of unwritten atoms exceeds the high watermark.
    The threads will unblock once the queues drain below the low
    watermark level.
")

(set-procedure-property! sql-set-stall-writers! 'documentation
"
 sql-set-stall-writers! BOOL - Set the stall flag on the writeback
    queues. If the flag is set, then the writers will 'stall', i.e.
    avoid doing any actual stores until the writeback queues have
    at least the low-watermark pending writes in them.
")

(set-procedure-property! sql-stats 'documentation
"
 sql-stats - report performance statistics.
    This will cause some database performance statistics to be printed
    to the stdout of the server. These statistics can be quite arcane
    and are useful primarily to the developers of the database backend.
