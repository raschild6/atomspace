 cog-randgen-set-seed! SEED

    Set the random seed of OpenCog's random generator to SEED.

    Warning: this function affects OpenCog's random generator only.
    If you want to set the seed of scheme's native random generator
    use `*random-state*` instead.

    OpenCog offers its own random generator singleton (defined in
    cogutil) to have a central point of control (random seed, etc)
    which can make it easier to achieve reproducability. Note that
    it is neither guarantied nor even desirable that all components
    use OpenCog's random generator. However for those that do, such
    a binding is provided.

(set-procedure-property! cog-randgen-randint 'documentation

 cog-randgen-randint N

    Return a random integer between 0 and N excluded using OpenCog's
    random generator.

    Warning: this function affects OpenCog's random generator only.
    If you want to select a random integer using scheme's native
    random generator, use `random` instead.

 cog-randgen-float

    Return a random float within [0, 1].

    If you want to select a random floating number using scheme's
    native random generator, use `random:uniform` instead.
